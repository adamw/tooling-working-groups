# Scala Tooling Working Group Elections

The following rules shall govern the elections to Scala Tooling working groups.

1. Elections will be held to determine the members of the Scala LSP Working
   Group (LSP-WG) and the Scala Tooling Protocols Working Group (STP-WG).

2. The elections will select between six and eight members for each working
   group.

3. Any individual is eligible to stand as a candidate. Corporations and other
   organizations are not eligible, but elected members may represent an
   organization.

4. At least two individuals should be members of both LSP-WG and STP-WG.

5. At least one member of LSP-WG and one member of STP-WG should be a
   representative of the Scala Center.

6. The elections serve to select the initial members of the working groups, and
   defer subsequent decisions on membership to the working groups themselves.

7. The elections will take place online starting at 6pm UTC on 28 February
   2018, and will be conducted by a presiding officer over several rounds to
   elect members of both groups.

8. Any individual will be eligible to vote no more than once in each round of
   voting. Uniqueness of electors will be determined by name and Google
   account. Electors will be required to have a Google account.

9. Each round of voting will elect one individual to either or both groups.

10. Any elected candidate will not be a candidate in subsequent rounds of
    voting.

11. The first two rounds will each elect one individual to both LSP-WG and
    STP-WG, from the subset of candidates who are standing for both groups.

12. If fewer than three candidates are standing for election to both working
    groups, then the second or both of the rounds described in (11) shall be
    omitted as necessary, with fewer than two candidates elected.

13. If, after the first two rounds, the working groups include no members
    representing the Scala Center, one round will be held for each working
    group to elect one candidate from the subset of candidates representing the
    Scala Center.
    
14. If only one candidate is standing for election in any of the aforesaid
    rounds of voting then she or he will be appointed without a vote.

14. A proxy candidate called "Nobody else" will additionally stand in each
    subsequent round of voting.

15. A number of subsequent rounds will proceed to elect members alternately to
    each working group until either the maximum of eight members is reached for
    that group, or "Nobody else" is elected.

16. Every round of voting shall be an independent single transferable vote
    (STV) election, and electors will specify an ordered list of candidates,
    though a user interface convenient for doing so, announced by the presiding
    officer.

17. The rounds of voting shall be carried out one after the other, with enough
    time allocated to each round for electors to comfortably specify their
    preference order, and with enough time provided between voting rounds to
    announce the elected candidate and prepare the next round. This time will
    be determined and announced by the presiding officer, but is estimated to
    be approximately five minutes per round.

18. Anonymized voting data for each round shall be made available automatically
    to every candidate, and to anyone else on request.

19. In the event that an exceptional circumstance should arise which is not
    covered by these articles, the presiding officer shall decide upon an
    appropriate course of action.
